# JD-Bookstore

## Project Introduction

The Book Store is an online book-listing webpage that utilises Google Book API to extract information from a JSON array containing different HTML5 books. The website is aimed to be responsive and user friendly hence the specific design choices. 

## Testing 

This webpage has been tested thoroughly using Developer Tools on different browsers and on different viewports. These browsers include Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox. It has also been tested across different mobile and tablet devices to ensure responsiveness is achieved. Furthermore, the HTML, CSS & JavaScript code has been checked on NU HTML Checker, W3C CSS Validation Service, and JSHint.
